# Exploring-the-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market

Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in Internet slang). Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future1. In fact, on the 6th of December 2017, Bitcoin has a market capitalization above $200 billion.
WARNING: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile2 and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Cryptocurrencies mentioned here might be scams similar to Ponzi Schemes or have many other issues (overvaluation, technical, etc.). Please do not mistake this for investment advice.
